Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room developed an app called "Draw it or Lose it" where an image is rendered and players must make a guess on what that image is. The 
Gaming Room wants to expand and make their app aviable accross multiple devices.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

In this project I went through alot of resources inorder to learn about this topic. This classs was rather different from previous programming classes.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I like the design document to be a pre plan on what the code will look like. It offeres different suggestions based on the clinets needs and budget. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would like to revise the module 4 working with Maven. I feel I could have done that better. It was alot to learn and I would like to improve my abilities.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
One of the basic user need is information safety and it was incorporated. User's needs are important because you have to be able to predict how the users will 
interact with the application, is it user friendly.


How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
In this approch I analized the developers needs. Costs and requirements and worked from that point.
